Minimal and simpler alternative to the futures crate.

The pasts asynchronous runtime is designed for creating user-space software and
embedded software using an asynchronous event loop.  It aims to abstract away
all of the pain points of using asynchronous Rust.  Pasts is purposely kept
small with the entire source directory under 500 lines of Rust code.

Check out the [documentation][0] for examples.

# Goals
 - No unsafe (safe and sound)
 - No required std (executor requires two allocations at startup, if needed can
   use a bump allocator with small capacity)
 - No macros (fast compile times)
 - No dependencies[^1] (bloat-free)
 - No cost (true zero-cost abstractions)
 - No pain (API super easy to learn & use)
 - No platform-specific API differences (code works everywhere).

### Supported Platforms
Pasts targets all platforms that can run Rust.  The executor works
on at least the following platforms (may work on others):
 - All platforms that support threading (includes all tier 1 and some tier 2, 3)
 - Web Assembly In Browser (Tier 2)
 - No standard devices (Tiers 2 and 3)

## Related Projects
Since pasts is not an all-in-one async runtime solution, here's a list of crates
that are designed to work well with pasts:

 - [Async Main](https://docs.rs/crate/async_main/latest) - Proc macro crate to
   remove boilerplate for the main function.
 - [Whisk](https://docs.rs/crate/whisk/latest) - A no-std-compatible MPMC
   (multi-producer/multiple-consumer) asynchronous channel implementation
 - [Smelling Salts](https://docs.rs/crate/smelling_salts/latest) - Abstraction
   over OS APIs to handle asynchronous device waking by implementing `Notifier`

      - **`web`** pulls in [`wasm-bindgen-futures`][14]
